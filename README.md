# F1-FIA-regulation-summerize-with-Retrieval-Augmented-Generation-RAG-model
This uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to summarize and extract information from FIA F1 World Championship documents. Instead of parsing the document, it extracts the embeddings from the document files and then processes those through an LLM to obtain the desired information.
